# Why React 18?

React 18 officially supports Suspense, enabling the encapsulation of asynchronous data fetching within components using only React's standard features during SSR.

Consequently, frameworks no longer need to provide special functions like getStaticProps or getServerSideProps, allowing for a more minimalist framework approach and granting developers a more liberated development experience.

This is a key reason to target React 18.
